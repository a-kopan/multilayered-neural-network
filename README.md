# Multilayered Feed-Forward Network

## About

In this assignment, the task is to implement a multilayered feed-forward network for regression and classification problems.

The main goals of this exercise are to:

Understand the architecture of feed-forward neural networks.

Learn optimization methods using backpropagation and mini-batch gradient descent.

* [ ] Explore hyperparameter selection for training.
